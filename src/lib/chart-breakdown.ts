/**
 * chart-breakdown.ts — shared pure util for chart tooltip / stacked-member
 * breakdowns (FINLYNQ-128, reused by FINLYNQ-129's stacked-member toggle).
 *
 * A "breakdown" is the per-member decomposition of an aggregate value at one
 * point on a value-over-time chart:
 *   - Net Worth Over Time → per ACCOUNT
 *   - Income vs Expenses   → per CATEGORY
 *   - Performance          → per HOLDING (market value $) — deferred, see item
 *
 * `rankBreakdown` ranks members descending by ABSOLUTE contribution and
 * collapses everything past `maxMembers` into a single "Other" residual row, so
 * a tooltip never lists more than `maxMembers + 1` rows. The residual preserves
 * the grand total: top-N + Other === sum of all members (modulo float).
 *
 * PURE / CLIENT-SAFE: zero deps, no @/db, no next/server, no Date.now(). Safe to
 * import from "use client" components AND from API route handlers that pre-shape
 * the breakdown payload.
