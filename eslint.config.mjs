    // total across 12 rules on the dev HEAD this baseline was originally cut
    // against). They are downgraded from `error` to `warn` so the blocking
    // ESLint CI step (ci.yml `Lint`) gates only on errors — `npm run lint`
    // exits 0 with warnings, non-zero on any error. Every rule NOT listed
    // here keeps its current severity, so the CI step still catches any
    // FUTURE new-rule error. Burn down each rule's backlog and re-promote it
    // to `error` here per the follow-up; the step's teeth grow as that
    // happens. Do NOT add new violations of these rules — fix them at source.
    //
    // FINLYNQ-119 (2026-06-04) burned down + RE-PROMOTED the 7 quick-win /
    // small-count rules — they were removed from this block and now run at
    // their default `error` severity (zero violations repo-wide):
    //   prefer-const, react-hooks/rules-of-hooks, react-hooks/use-memo,

    //   @typescript-eslint/no-require-imports (the lone pg-shim require carries
    //     a justified file-scoped disable),
    //   react/display-name (never had a violation),
    //   react/no-unescaped-entities (last escapes landed in FINLYNQ-143/144).
